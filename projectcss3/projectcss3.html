                <h2>ORGANIC FARMING</h2>
               
               <P2>
                Bhutanese agriculture is characterized by traditional farming practices with
                low or no external inputs and dependent mainly on renewable natural
                resources which are available locally. Religious sentiments in Bhutan are  such
                that our farmers would choose the alternative means of soil fertility
                management and pest control, like use of repellents and protectants if available,
                rather than the use of chemical inputs.
                Developmentally, agricultural production is rapidly moving from subsistence
                towards commercial farming with direct government support, both in terms
                of policy as well as infrastructure development. While pursuing the
                developmental goals enshrined in “Vision 2020” the Royal Government has
                taken the Middle Path policy of balancing the safety of the environment and
                protecting the profit of our farmers.
                The demand for organic products creates new export opportunities. Organic exports are sold at
                impressive premiums, often at prices 20% higher than the same products produced on non-organic
                farms. Under the right circumstances the market returns from organic agriculture can potentially
                contribute to local food security by increasing family incomes.
                Entering this lucrative market is not easy. Farmers require hiring an organic certification organization
                to annually inspect and confirm that their farms and businesses adhere to the organic standards
                established by various trading partners. During the conversion period to organic management, which
                lasts 2 to 3 years, farmers cannot sell their produce as “organic” and thus, tap price premiums. This is
                because consumers expect organic produce to be free of residues. However, according to the Codex
                Guidelines on Organically Produced Food (2007), products produced on land under organic
                management for at least one year, but less than the two-three year requirement could be sold as
                “transition to organic”; but very few markets have developed for such products.
